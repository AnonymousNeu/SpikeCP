# SpikeCP

Code for SpikeCP

SpikeCP is guaranteed to be reliable in the sense that the true class $c$ is included in the predicted set $\Gamma(x)$, produced at the stopping time $T_s(x)$, with probability no smaller than the desired accuracy level  $p_{\rm targ}$. The probability is taken over the distribution of the test data point and of the calibration data.
